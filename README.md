 The AMCAT (Aspiring Minds Computer Adaptive Test) is a widely recognized assessment designed to evaluate candidatesâ€™ aptitude, reasoning, technical proficiency, and domain knowledge. It provides valuable insights into individual strengths and areas for improvement while offering recruiters standardized metrics to assess job readiness.

This project conducted a comprehensive analysis of AMCAT data through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques. Utilizing the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, we identified anomalies that could impact performance evaluation. The study examined score distributions, correlations across skill areas, and candidate performance trends to derive meaningful insights.

Our findings emphasize key determinants of AMCAT scores, highlighting the influence of logical reasoning, quantitative aptitude, and technical skills on overall performance. Seaborn boxplots effectively visualized outliers, enabling data-driven decision-making.

This study underscores the importance of a strategic, data-driven approach to AMCAT preparation, helping candidates focus on weaker areas to enhance their performance. Additionally, recruiters and educators can leverage these insights to refine evaluation criteria and training programs.

By integrating statistical analysis and machine learning, future research can further enhance predictive models for performance forecasting and personalized recommendations, making AMCAT preparation more efficient and impactful.
